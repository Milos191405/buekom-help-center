So I have been using Proxmox for a while now and seen a video that you can remove the ‘local-lvm’ from Proxmox and just have the ‘local’ storage drive. So here is the steps to do that.

1. Click on “Datacenter” and then click on “Storage”.
    
2. Click on “local-lvm” and click on “Remove” (Don’t worry, it’s not a bad thing)
    
3. Once it is removed, click on the node and click “shell”.
    
4. Enter the following commands:
    

lvremove /dev/pve/data

lvresize -l +100%FREE /dev/pve/root

resize2fs /dev/mapper/pve-root

Once you have that done, you should see the ‘local’ storage increase to the max size of the volume of your harddrive. Enjoy!
