### Hardware Requirements

- **Processor**: A minimum of a dual-core CPU is recommended for basic Mailcow functionality. For higher email traffic, a quad-core CPU or better is advisable. 
- **Memory**: At least 2 GB of RAM is required. For optimal performance, especially in environments with multiple users or high email volumes, 4 GB or more is preferred. 
- **Storage**: A minimum of 20 GB of storage space is necessary. However, considering email data and backups, 50 GB or more is recommended for long-term usage. 
- **Network**: A stable internet connection with a static IP address is ideal for seamless email server operation. 

### Software Requirements

- **Linux Distribution**: Mailcow is compatible with most modern Linux distributions. Debian and Ubuntu are commonly recommended due to their widespread use and compatibility. 
- **Docker and Docker Compose**: Since Mailcow runs within Docker containers, ensure that Docker and Docker Compose are available on your Linux distribution. 
- **SSL/TLS Certificate**: For secure email communication, an SSL/TLS certificate is necessary. You can obtain this from a certificate authority (CA) or use Let Us Encrypt for a free certificate. 

## Installing Mailcow 

This chapter provides a detailed guide on installing Mailcow on Debian 11, including DNS settings. It is important to follow these steps carefully to ensure a successful installation. 

### Full Step-by-Step Installation Guide on Debian 11 

### Preparing the System 

**Update System Packages**: 

```sql
sudo apt update 
sudo apt upgrade
```

**Install Required Dependencies**: 

```undefined
sudo apt install curl git
```

### Installing Docker and Docker Compose 

**Install Docker**: 

```csharp
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh 
sudo sh get-docker.sh
```

**Install Docker Compose**: 

```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose 
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose 
```

### Configuring DNS Settings 

Before installing Mailcow, configure DNS settings for your domain. The full and detailed DNS Setup can be found in [Mailcow’s Official Documentation](https://docs.mailcow.email/prerequisite/prerequisite-dns/?ref=192.168.0.149). 

- **Set an A Record**: Point your domain (e.g., mail.example.com) to the server’s IP address. 
- **MX Record**: Set an MX record for your domain pointing to your Mailcow server (e.g., mail.example.com). 
- **SPF Record**: Create an SPF record to prevent email spoofing (e.g., v=spf1 mx ~all). 
- **DKIM and DMARC**: These will be configured post-installation within Mailcow. 

### Installing Mailcow 

**Clone the Mailcow Repository**: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized 
cd mailcow-dockerized
```

**Generate Configuration File**: 

```bash
./generate_config.sh
```

When prompted, enter your domain (e.g., mail.example.com). 

**Start Mailcow**: 

```undefined
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

### Verifying the Installation 

Check if all containers are running: 

```undefined
sudo docker-compose ps 
```

### Initial Configuration Settings 

After the installation, you need to perform initial configuration: 

**Access Mailcow UI**: Open a web browser and go to [https://mail.example.com](https://mail.example.com/?ref=192.168.0.149). You will be greeted by the Mailcow UI. 

**Log in to Admin Panel**: 

Default credentials are usually admin for username and moohoo for password. 

**Change Admin Password**: 

Go to ‘Configuration’ -> ‘Mail setup’ and change the admin password. 

**Configure DKIM and DMARC**: 

In Mailcow UI, navigate to ‘Configuration’ -> ‘ARC/DKIM keys’. 

Generate a new key and add the displayed DKIM record to your DNS settings. 

For DMARC, add a DMARC TXT record in your DNS settings (e.g., v=DMARC1; p=none; [rua=mailto:postmaster@mail.example.com](mailto:rua=mailto:postmaster@mail.example.com)). 

**Create Mailboxes**: 

Use the Mailcow UI to create user mailboxes as needed. 

**Test Email Functionality**: 

Send and receive test emails to ensure everything is working correctly. 

## Configuring Mailcow 

Once Mailcow is installed, the next step is to configure it for your specific needs. This chapter focuses on setting up domains and mailboxes, which are crucial for personalizing and operationalizing your email server. 

### Setting Up Domains 

To begin sending and receiving emails, you need to add your domain(s) to Mailcow. Here is how to do it: 

**Access Mailcow UI**: Navigate to your Mailcow UI by entering [https://mail.example.com](https://mail.example.com/?ref=192.168.0.149) in your web browser. 

**Log in**: Use your admin credentials to log in. 

**Navigate to Domain Section**: 

In the Mailcow UI, go to the ‘Configuration’ tab. 

Under ‘Mail setup’, select ‘Domains’. 

**Add a New Domain**: 

Click on ‘Add domain’. 

Enter your domain name (e.g., example.com). 

Configure additional settings like Quota, Backup MX, and Active status as per your requirements. 

**Save Changes**: Click ‘Add domain’ to save the configuration. 

**Verify the Domain**: 

Ensure that your DNS settings are correctly pointing to your Mailcow server (as configured in the previous chapter). 

Mailcow might perform some checks to verify domain ownership. 

### Setting Up Mailboxes 

After adding your domain, the next step is to create mailboxes for individual users or purposes. 

**Navigate to Mailbox Section**: 

Under the ‘Mail setup’ tab, select ‘Mailboxes’. 

**Create a New Mailbox**: 

Click on ‘Add mailbox’. 

Fill in the required details: 

**Local Part**: The part of the email before the @ (e.g., user for [user@example.com](mailto:user@example.com)). 

**Domain**: Select the domain you added earlier. 

**Password**: Set a strong password for the mailbox. 

**Full Name**: The name of the user or purpose of the mailbox. 

**Quota**: Set the storage limit for the mailbox. 

**Save the Mailbox**: Click ‘Add mailbox’ to create the mailbox. 

**Repeat for Additional Mailboxes**: Follow the same steps to create more mailboxes as needed. 

**Accessing Mailboxes**: 

Users can access their mailboxes through the webmail interface or by configuring their email client with the newly created email credentials. 

**Testing**: 

It is important to test the new mailboxes by sending and receiving emails to ensure everything is functioning correctly. 

With these steps, you have successfully configured domains and mailboxes in Mailcow. This configuration is the heart of your email server, allowing you and others to start using it for daily email communication. Remember to periodically review and update these settings as your needs evolve.
