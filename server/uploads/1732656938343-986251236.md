Wenn die IP-Adresse geändert wird wegen Umzug oder die VM geklont wird, weil eine zweite Instanz hersoll.

If you want to change the URL of your self-hosted Ghost site, there are a few steps to make, but luckily they are very straight-forward.

## Step 1: Update your domain's DNS

You will first need to point your new domain to your server. This is done by creating an A record in your domain provider pointing to your server's IP address.

## Step 2: Edit your site's config file

The next step is to log on to your server and edit your Ghost site's URL.

`cd` into the correct folder where Ghost is located (on Digital Ocean, it will be in `/var/www/ghost`) and run

`ghost config url https://yournewdomain.com`

Make sure to add the protocol (`https` in this example).

## Step 3: Set up Nginx

Now run `ghost setup nginx`. This will set up some server-level files for serving your Ghost site for the domain.

## Step 4: Create an SSL certificate

Run `ghost setup ssl`. This will go through the Let's Encrypt process for creating a fresh (free) SSL certificate. You will need to input an email address during the installation.

## Step 5: Restart Ghost

Run `ghost restart` to reload the Ghost software (this refreshes all the links across your site).

And you're done!
