# How to use Set-Inform to adopt Unifi Access Point

[LAST UPDATED¬†JANUARY 9, 2024](https://lazyadmin.nl/home-network/unifi-set-inform/ "13:17")¬†BY¬†[RUDY MENS](https://lazyadmin.nl/author/lajcud8123b/ "View all posts by Rudy Mens")[46 COMMENTS](https://lazyadmin.nl/home-network/unifi-set-inform/#comments)

Unifi Access points are great devices, most of the time when you connect a new Access Point they will find the controller within a minute. But what if your new access point isn‚Äôt showing up in your controller?

When the status led of your new access point is steady white (or steady amber for older access points) then it‚Äôs waiting for adoption. But sometimes the device won‚Äôt show up in the controller.

In this article, I will explain how you can use the Set-Inform command on an Unifi Access Point.

## Use Set-Inform on Unifi Access Point

The Set-Inform URL tells the Unifi Access Point where the controller is located. By default, the access point will search the network for the controller, using the default DNS name¬†**unifi**. This doesn‚Äôt always work, so we need to tell the access point the correct address of the Unifi Controller.

To set the inform URL we need to connect over SSH to the Unifi access point. You don‚Äôt need an SSH client for this, we can simply use PowerShell for this, which is installed by default on all Windows 10 and 11 computers.

The default SSH username and password are¬†**ubnt**. If you have changed it, then you can look it up in the controller under¬†**System**¬†>¬†**Application Configuration**¬†>¬†**Device SSH Authentication**.

> Note
> 
> The default inform url is http://**unifi**:8080/inform. Unifi is the internal DNS name of your Unifi Controller. This doesn‚Äôt always work, better is to use the IP Address of the controller, for example: http://192.168.1.1:8080/inform

We also need to know the IP Address of the access point. You can use the Ubiquiti Discovery Tool for this or¬†[Advanced Ip Scanner](https://lazyadmin.nl/go/program/advanced-ip-scanner/ "Advanced Ip Scanner").

1. **Open PowerShell**
    
      
    We first need to connect the access point over SSH. To do this we are going to use PowerShell.  
      
    1. Press Windows key + X (or right-click your start menu)  
    2. Choose Windows PowerShell
    
2. **Connect SSH**
    
      
    Type¬†
    
    ssh ubnt@192.168.1.142
    
    ¬†(replace 192.168.1.142 with the IP Address of your access point)  
      
    Enter the default password¬†**ubnt**¬†(or lookup the SSH details in your controller)  
      
    ![SSH Unifi Access Point](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20718%20322'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
    
3. **Set-Inform URL**
    
      
    The inform URL is the IP Address of your controller followed by the port number: 8080/inform.  
      
    So if the IP Address of your controller is 192.168.1.1, then the inform URL is :  
    `http://192.168.1.1:8080/inform`  
      
    Type the following command and press enter:  
    
    set-inform http://192.168.1.1:8080/inform
    
      
      
    ![unifi set-inform](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20718%20322'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
    
4. **Complete the adoption in the controller**
    
      
    You should now see the access point in the controller, ready for adoption.  
      
    ![Adopt unifi access point](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201288%20728'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
    

If the access point still doesn‚Äôt show up in the controller, then check if the settings are applied correctly. Type info and press enter to see the status of the access point:

UAP-AC-Lite-BZ.5.43.36# info

Model: UAP-AC-Lite

Version: 5.43.36.12724

MAC Address: f0:9f:c2:f6:d1:fd

IP Address: 192.168.1.142

Hostname: UAP-AC-Lite

Uptime: 633 seconds

Status: Not Adopted (http://192.168.1.1:8080/inform)

UAP-AC-Lite-BZ.5.43.36#

As you can see in the results above, the inform URL is set correctly, but the device is still waiting for adoption.

        It really should be¬†`ubnt`¬†for both the username and password. Only other option for access points is the older username and password¬†`ui`. Only other option is to factory reset the access point.

    This a very well done DOC! Thanks much. At first it didn‚Äôt work because I can‚Äôt comprehend what I read. üôÇ I set the access point ip instead of the server. But once I read again, it worked perfectly. I think I could have just set up an alias for the server as unify, but I was already in there doing it. Seems odd that 7 others joined just fine, but not this one. Anyhow thanks much.

    Hi Rudy,  
    I‚Äôm reaching out to you because you have this set-inform blog from 2022, as set-inform is my focal point.
    
    Does anyone use a Unifi AP, physically located on a LAN other than the controller and then change the set-inform ip to a WAN adr. on another site?
    
    Of course, with setting up NAT and firewall rules on the receiving site, and NAT will point AP to the controller.
    
    Does that make any sense?
    
    Cause:
    
    Has quite a few Unifi APs sitting out there, but without a controller since it‚Äôs on my laptop.
    
    But to update or view other data, etc., my laptop needs to go to the physical place where AP is located. But I‚Äôve learned that it‚Äôs possible to change the set-inform adr. and then have the traffic sent to another controller.
    
    However, my biggest problem is that this set-inform cmd is on port http / 8080 and thus completely without security or encryption of traffic between sites.
    
    Therefore, this set-inform cmd is probably intended only for local networks, but just wanted to hear your opinion.
    
    Thanks in advance to everyone.
    
    Kenneth
    
    PS. I know I can change the port 8080 to something else, but http is what it is.

        Yes, that is defitnely possible. I have managed more then 30 access points this way. Check out¬†[this article](https://lazyadmin.nl/home-network/unifi-cloud-controller/)¬†on setting up a controller in the cloud. It will explain a bit on how to work with set-inform and public IP Addresses.

    Best and easiest to follow how to change inform address.  
    I have followed others with putty. Some times worked some times didn‚Äôt.
    
    When I found and tested this I was floored how easy it worked.
    
    Now to figure out how to get higher speeds from my Unifi AC Mesh units.

    Hi,  
    I have several APs and Switches into a single location already provisioned in a windows server with UniFi controller installed.  
    Now I‚Äôm gonna move the controller server in another LAN subnet, so I‚Äôm wondering if set-inform command would re-register all APs and switches, while keeping the existing configuration, or they would result in a factory reset.
    
    Thanks

        If you have moved all devices to the new VLAN then you should indeed be able to point them to the controller with the set-inform command.

    Hi ‚Äì we have a bit of a unique situation (don‚Äôt we all):
    
    We have 3 AC-Pros that were connected to a CoudKey Gen2+. We upgraded the controller from the CloudKey to a UDM Pro and restored the configuration from the CloudKey. Everything worked fine for months. Suddenly, everything that was not wired to the UDM went to ‚Äòoffline‚Äô (the wired switches do not seem to be impacted by any of this at all).
    
    We have factory reset the APs multiple (multiple) times, set-inform multiple times, can CLI into the AP‚Äôs with their status showing as ‚Äòconnected‚Äô and ‚Äòsynchronized‚Äô and despite all that the status in both the app and the browser control panel always fail to adopt or go offline after adoption. I did notice on one of the resets that the app sent a notification that ‚ÄúAdmin adopted UAP-AC-Pro to {name of old CloudKey}‚Äù, but there was no consistent pattern to that notice.
    
    The best result so far has been that for one of the APs the adoption proceeds and ends with the AP offline, accessible via CLI, but cannot be managed via the controller or app. The other APs fail adoption. I do see app notifications related to devices offline, devices adopting etc always referring to the old CloudKey and not the new UDM, but not sure where to track that down especially since the old CLoudKey has been in a box for moths and not connected to the network anywhere.
    
    Any suggestions on trails to follow?

        Have you checked the firmware versions? Make sure that both UDM and AP‚Äôs are up to date. Only other option would be to reset the UDM and start with a fresh config.

    Hi, I have a small unify network (5 UAPs, USG, Cloud key Gen1, and US-8-60W, running fine for 5 years.  
    Yesterday I swapped out the US-8-60W for a new USW-24-POE 24 switch, and when accessing the Cloud key config from my PC, it does not find the USW-24-POE 24??  
    I can ping it and they are on same subnet (cloudkey 192.168.0.146, UWS 192.168.0.250). I can see the USW as a Unifi client.  
    My iphone Unifi app sees the USW-24-POE 24, however adoption fails.  
    Cloud Key is running version 6.5.55-16678-1, and fails to upgrade to 7.2.97-18705-1.  
    My admin passwords do not work when I try and SSH into Cloud key from powershell. Would this be related?  
    Do I need to backup the Cloudkey, and factory reset, upgrade to 7.2.97-18705-1, when restore from backup?

        Yeah, you should get the firmware fixed on the Cloudkey. I would indeed start with resetting the Cloudkey and restore it from a backup.

    Hello,  
    Its looks like there is no data transfer between  
    my controller (network application for windows 7.2.95) and UAP-nanoHD 6.2.49 (the latest)  
    The UAP address is correct (starts with 10.0) the status is always ‚Äúadopting‚Äù,  
    and I can‚Äôt see the WIFI clients that connected to the AP.  
    In the Wi-Fi settings when I un-pause a paused WLAN its not turned on that WLAN.
    
    In Unifi for Android, I can see that there are connected clients.  
    What the red ‚ÄúRestart‚Äù doing in the Unifi for Android ?  
    Is there a way in Android to add/remove and/or pause/un-pause WLAN
    
    Thanks,  
    Giora

        Check if the firmware and console are up-to-date. Often an old firmware on the UAP can cause adoption issues.

        Can you ping the controller from the AC? Ip address 41.xx seems like a public IP, both devices are in the same range? In the case of an online controller, have you checked the firewall settings?
        
        Also, the firmware on the access point is behind, you can try to¬†[update it over SSH](https://lazyadmin.nl/home-network/update-unifi-firmware/).

            Hi Rudy,  
            1. Yes I can ping the controller from the AP.  
            2. We‚Äôre on public IP (hence censoring IP) and yes devices are in the same subnet (range)
            
            3. Firewall settings on my PC? I have both my PC (Controller) and the AP connected to the same cisco switch.
            
            4. I have updated to the recent firmware via SSH.
            
            THANKS

                Firewall on your computer won‚Äôt be an issue if think (you can test it by simply turning it off it‚Äôs running). When access points don‚Äôt want to adopt, then often it‚Äôs a version mismatch between the controller and access point. You have updated the firmware on the access point, is the controller also running the latest version?

                    Yes to both questions! Let me try and use another PC. I suspect port 8080 is busy.

    We have an old unifi controller running on a non accessable vmware machine.  
    We wish to setup a new unifi controller but when we startup new AP‚Äôs we can‚Äôt see them in the new (test) unifi controller.  
    Even when we set-inform in this case to my ip adres that is running the unifi controller software it won‚Äôt show up. (Status: Timeout ([https://10.74.0.143:8443/inform](https://10.74.0.143:8443/inform)))  
    From the AP I can ping the adres.
    
    What am I doing wrong?

    My problem is my USG-16-150W won‚Äôt adopt. I tried to SSH into it‚Äôs IP address but the connection is refused. Can I use the console connection on the back to accomplish this task?

        yes, that should work. You will need an RJ45-to-DB9, serial console cable, and use the following settings for the connection:
        
        `    ‚Ä¢ Baud rate 115200   ‚Ä¢ Data bits 8   ‚Ä¢ Parity NONE   ‚Ä¢ Stop bits 1   ‚Ä¢ Flow control NONE    `

    With your DCHP servers, tell the Unifi equipment where the controller is.  
    Use DHCP Option 43. You identify your Unify server in hex. It *MUST* be prefixed with 01 04, then the hex value of your unify server‚Äôs IP address. (This is what Unify does when you use their equipment and declare where your UniFi server/console is.)

    For my pfSense, I have to do it like this:  
    DHCP Option 43, Select String, and for an IP address of 10.0.0.10, your string value would be: 01:04:0A:00:00:0A
    
    Read the documentation on your specific format for your DHCP server.
    
    This fixed many problems across my test lab when playing with subnets.

    Thanks a lot! Worked like a charm here.  
    One observation though: Windows 10 ssh implementation failed connecting to the AP whereas Putty worked fine, same copy ‚Äì pasted password (with shift-insert). Did not try with Powershell, but I do remember having earlier used the Powershell ssh just fine.

    Hey, sorry but i think i found out what the problem is!
    
    My Unifi Controller is a Docker Container. If i lost power supply, the container gets a new internal IP Adresse. That is confusing for the set inform adresse. I think i have to set the IP of the Container Static.. but i dont actually know how to do this.. Maybe i‚Äôll find it out and tell it here.

        Which docker container are you using? With the jacobalberty/unifi container you could try to use the ‚Äìnet=host option in the docker run. Then it will take the IP of the host. But you will need to check the port number and make sure that you don‚Äôt get any conflicts.

    No, i think you dont understand me‚Ä¶  
    if i change the inform adresse and my power supply is broken ‚Äì the inform adress resets everytime from a specific IP to 172.17.0.9‚Ä¶
    
    i dont want to login every time in with ssh so i change in the dns the route of 172.17.0.9 to the valid ip‚Ä¶ cause my AP‚Äôs dont remember!

    Hi, sry but it cant! i repeat it very often. I have to set the inform adresse every time again. Yes the AP‚Äôs get connection to my controller (hosted with a docker container)‚Ä¶
    
    My Workaround: Change the DNS of the given IP in my case 172.17.0.9 to the right IP of the controller‚Ä¶ But thats not the solution with the set inform adresse from this guide here. I just want to understand why it doesnt work.

        But that sounds more like a DNS issue then. You could also use the IP Address of the controller instead of the DNS name.

        The access point will remember the last set-inform as well, in case the newly set one doesn‚Äôt work. Are you sure that the AP can access the controller?
