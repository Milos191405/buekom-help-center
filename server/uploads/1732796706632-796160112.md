Benutze das example without any proxy unten auf der Seite nachdem der Ordner files angelegt und die Persmissions gesetzt sind.

## File permissions [#](https://vikunja.io/docs/full-docker-example?ref=192.168.0.149#file-permissions)

Vikunja runs as user `1000` and no group by default. You can use Docker's [`--user`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/?ref=192.168.0.149#user) flag to change that.

You must ensure Vikunja is able to write into the `files` directory. To do this, create the folder and chown it before starting the stack:

```bash
mkdir $PWD/files
chown 1000 $PWD/files
```

You'll need to do this before running any of the examples on this page.

Vikunja will not try to acquire ownership of the files folder, as that would mean it had to run as root.

## PostgreSQL [#](https://vikunja.io/docs/full-docker-example?ref=192.168.0.149#postgresql)

Vikunja supports postgres, mysql and sqlite as a database backend. The examples on this page use mysql with a mariadb container. To use postgres as a database backend, change the `db` section of the examples to this:

```yaml
db:
  image: postgres:16
  environment:
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD: changeme
    POSTGRES_USER: vikunja
  volumes:
    - ./db:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  restart: unless-stopped
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -h localhost -U $$POSTGRES_USER"]
    interval: 2s
```

You'll also need to change the `VIKUNJA_DATABASE_TYPE` to `postgres` on the api container declaration.

## Sqlite [#](https://vikunja.io/docs/full-docker-example?ref=192.168.0.149#sqlite)

Vikunja supports postgres, mysql and sqlite as a database backend. The examples on this page use mysql with a mariadb container. To use sqlite as a database backend, change the `api` section of the examples to this:

```yaml
vikunja:
  image: vikunja/vikunja
  environment:
    VIKUNJA_SERVICE_JWTSECRET: <a super secure random secret>
    VIKUNJA_SERVICE_PUBLICURL: http://<your public frontend url with slash>/
    # Note the default path is /app/vikunja/vikunja.db.
    # This config variable moves it to a different folder so you can use a volume and 
    # store the database file outside the container so state is persisted even if the container is destroyed.
    VIKUNJA_DATABASE_PATH: /db/vikunja.db
  ports:
    - 3456:3456
  volumes:
    - ./files:/app/vikunja/files
    - ./db:/db
  restart: unless-stopped
```

The default path Vikunja uses for sqlite is relative to the binary, which in the docker container would be `/app/vikunja/vikunja.db`. The `VIKUNJA_DATABASE_PATH` environment variable moves changes it so that the database file is stored in a volume at `/db`, to persist state across restarts.

You'll also need to remove or change the `VIKUNJA_DATABASE_TYPE` to `sqlite` on the container declaration.

You can also remove the db section.

To run the container, you need to create the directories first and make sure they have all required permissions:

```bash
mkdir $PWD/files $PWD/db
chown 1000 $PWD/files $PWD/db
```

If you'll use your instance with more than a handful of users, we recommend using mysql or postgres.

## Example without any proxy [#](https://vikunja.io/docs/full-docker-example?ref=192.168.0.149#example-without-any-proxy)

This example lets you host Vikunja without any reverse proxy in front of it. This is the absolute minimum configuration you need to get something up and running. If you want to make Vikunja available on a domain or need tls termination, check out one of the other examples.

Note that you need to change the [`VIKUNJA_SERVICE_PUBLICURL`](https://vikunja.io/docs/config-options?ref=192.168.0.149#publicurl) environment variable to the public ip or hostname including the port (the docker host you're running this on) is reachable at, prefixed with `http://`. Because the browser you'll use to access the Vikunja frontend uses that url to make the requests, it has to be able to reach it from the outside.

You must ensure Vikunja has write permissions on the `files` directory before starting the stack. To do this, [check out the related commands here](https://vikunja.io/docs/full-docker-example?ref=192.168.0.149#file-permissions).

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  vikunja:
    image: vikunja/vikunja
    environment:
      VIKUNJA_SERVICE_PUBLICURL: http://<the public ip or host where Vikunja is reachable>
      VIKUNJA_DATABASE_HOST: db
      VIKUNJA_DATABASE_PASSWORD: changeme
      VIKUNJA_DATABASE_TYPE: mysql
      VIKUNJA_DATABASE_USER: vikunja
      VIKUNJA_DATABASE_DATABASE: vikunja
      VIKUNJA_SERVICE_JWTSECRET: <a super secure random secret>
    ports:

      MYSQL_USER: vikunja
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: changeme
      MYSQL_DATABASE: vikunja
    volumes:
      - ./db:/var/lib/mysql
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "mysqladmin ping -h localhost -u $$MYSQL_USER --password=$$MYSQL_PASSWORD"]
      interval: 2s
      start_period: 30s
