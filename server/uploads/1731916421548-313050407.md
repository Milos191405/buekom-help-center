Voraussetzung: Docker muss schon vorhanden sein 

1) The first step is to clone the netbox-docker repository to your computer. For that, open a terminal (e.g. Terminal on macOS or xterm on Linux).

    First you should navigate to the directory where you would like to clone the project to, e.g. ~/projects/.
    Second you have to clone the project.
    Then you should change to the new directory.#
	
mkdir -p ~/projects && cd projects
git clone -b release https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox-docker.git
cd netbox-docker

Now you need to create a new file which defines the port under which NetBox will be available.
The file name must be docker-compose.override.yml and its content should be as follows:

version: '3.4'
services:
  netbox:
    ports:
    - 8000:8080

docker compose pull
docker compose up

To create the first admin user run this command in a separate terminal:

docker compose exec netbox /opt/netbox/netbox/manage.py createsuperuser

2.1 Device-type library import:

pull a pre-built image from Github Container Registry (ghcr.io):
docker pull ghcr.io/minitriga/netbox-device-type-library-import

To run:

docker run -e "NETBOX_URL=http://netbox:8080/" -e "NETBOX_TOKEN=98765434567890" ghcr.io/minitriga/netbox-device-type-library-import

Important: before the last command create your token number in the Netbox GUI.#
