## Using the cli in docker [#](https://vikunja.io/docs/cli?ref=192.168.0.149#using-the-cli-in-docker)

When running Vikunja in docker, you'll need to execute all commands in the `vikunja` container. Instead of running the `vikunja` binary directly, run it like this:

```bash
docker exec <name of the Vikunja container> /app/vikunja/vikunja <subcommand>
```

If you need to run a bunch of Vikunja commands, you can also create a shell alias for it:

```bash
alias vikunja-docker='docker exec <name of the Vikunja container> /app/vikunja/vikunja'
```

Then use it as `vikunja-docker <subcommand>`.

## `dump` [#](https://vikunja.io/docs/cli?ref=192.168.0.149#dump)

Creates a zip file with all Vikunja-related files. This includes config, version, all files and the full database.

Usage:

```lua
vikunja dump
```

## `index` [#](https://vikunja.io/docs/cli?ref=192.168.0.149#index)

Perform a full reindex of all tasks into Typesense. This will clear all tasks already present in the index unless the `--partial` flag is provided, see below.

The command will only work if Typesense is enabled.

Flags:

- `-p`, `--partial`: If provided, Vikunja will only index tasks which are not present in the index yet.

Usage:

```css
vikunja index [flags]
```

## `help` [#](https://vikunja.io/docs/cli?ref=192.168.0.149#help)

Shows more detailed help about any command.

Usage:

```bash

```

## `migrate` [#](https://vikunja.io/docs/cli?ref=192.168.0.149#migrate)

Usage:

```css
vikunja migrate [flags]
vikunja migrate [command]
```

### `migrate list` [#](https://vikunja.io/docs/cli?ref=192.168.0.149#migrate-list)

Shows a list with all database migrations.

Usage:

```undefined

```

### `migrate rollback` [#](https://vikunja.io/docs/cli?ref=192.168.0.149#migrate-rollback)

Roll migrations back until a certain point.

Usage:

```css
vikunja migrate rollback [flags]
```

Flags:

- `-n`, `--name` string: The id of the migration you want to roll back until.

## `restore` [#](https://vikunja.io/docs/cli?ref=192.168.0.149#restore)

Restores a previously created dump from a zip file, see `dump`.

Usage:

```lua
vikunja restore [path to dump zip file]

## `testmail` [#](https://vikunja.io/docs/cli?ref=192.168.0.149#testmail)

```

## `user` [#](https://vikunja.io/docs/cli?ref=192.168.0.149#user)

Bundles a few commands to manage users.

### `user change-status` [#](https://vikunja.io/docs/cli?ref=192.168.0.149#user-change-status)

Enable or disable a user. Will toggle the current status if no flag (`--enable` or `--disable`) is provided.

Usage:

```css
vikunja user change-status [user id] [flags]
```

Flags:

- `-d`, `--disable`: Disable the user.
- `-e`, `--enable`: Enable the user.

### `user create` [#](https://vikunja.io/docs/cli?ref=192.168.0.149#user-create)

Create a new user.

Usage:

```sql
vikunja user create <flags>
```

Flags:

- `-a`, `--avatar-provider`: The avatar provider of the new user. Optional.
- `-e`, `--email`: The email address of the new user.
- `-p`, `--password`: The password of the new user. You will be asked to enter it if not provided through the flag.
- `-u`, `--username`: The username of the new user.

### `user delete` [#](https://vikunja.io/docs/cli?ref=192.168.0.149#user-delete)

Start the user deletion process. If called without the `--now` flag, this command will only trigger an email to the user in order for them to confirm and start the deletion process (this is the same behavior as if the user requested their deletion via the web interface). With the flag the user is deleted **immediately**.

**USE WITH CAUTION.**

```css
vikunja user delete [id] [flags]
```

Flags:

- `-n`, `--now` If provided, deletes the user immediately instead of emailing them first.

Reset a users password, either through mailing them a reset link or directly.

Usage:

```css
vikunja user reset-password [flags]
```

Flags:

- `-d`, `--direct`: If provided, reset the password directly instead of sending the user a reset mail.
- `-p`, `--password`: The new password of the user. Only used in combination with --direct. You will be asked to enter it if not provided through the flag.

### `user update` [#](https://vikunja.io/docs/cli?ref=192.168.0.149#user-update)
