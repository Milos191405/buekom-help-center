## Meet Your Host

I am a proud German-American who moved to Cape Coral, Florida, 15 years ago. With over 25 years of experience as a mechanic, I decided to embark on a new adventure by opening a jet ski and boat rental business in this beautiful city.

Cape Coral, with its stunning waterways and vibrant community, has been the perfect place to call home. My extensive background in mechanics has been invaluable in ensuring that our fleet of jet skis and boats is always in top-notch condition, providing our customers with safe and enjoyable experiences on the water.

Starting this business has been a rewarding journey, allowing me to combine my passion for mechanics with my love for the ocean. Whether you‚Äôre a local resident or a visitor, I invite you to explore the waters of Cape Coral with us and create unforgettable memories.
